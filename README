Buderus EMS Webinterface
(c) 2014 by Michael Moosbauer

This is the PHP Web Frontend that makes the features of the
ems-collector daemon accessible through HTTP.

For installation, see INSTALL.
For screenshots, look into the screenshots directory.
NOTE: The screenshots are not quite up-to-date, they are
from an older version without AJAX. In this version 
most of the "Setzen"-Buttons are away ;).

This work relies heavily of the ems-collector written by
Danny Baumann. Thanks to him for his excellent work.

NOTE: This version is NOT designed to be made available in the
      public internet! PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT ALL FILES ARE
      ONLY ACCESSIBLE IN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK OR IN A PASSWORD-
      PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT!
      Otherwise any bad guy will be able to reconfigure your
      heating system!!
