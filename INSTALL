This is the PHP Web Frontend that makes the features of the
ems-collector daemon accessible through HTTP.

This work relies heavily of the ems-collector written by 
Danny Baumann. Thanks to him for his excellent work.

NOTE: This version is NOT designed to be made available in the 
      public internet! PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT ALL FILES ARE
      ONLY ACCESSIBLE IN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK OR IN A PASSWORD-
      PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT! 
      Otherwise any bad guy will be able to reconfigure your
      heating system!!

Installation is not straightforward, as you need an PHP enabled
local webserver. Some experience with PHP-based websites is 
highly recommended.

You need:

1. A working ems-collector daemon that logs its data to 
   /var/log/ems/data.log. For this version you need the extended edition
   by Michael Moosbauer in the version 0.9 beta1 or above.
   You have to add the following OPTIONS to your /etc/default/ems-collector:

    -i -d data=/var/log/ems/data.log 

   You can cat the latest source of the modified ems-collector at
   https://github.com/moosy/ems-collector.

2. A working PHP environment with access to your EMS-mysql-database.

3. You have to ensure that the webserver can write to /tmp and to
   the subdirectory "graph" below your webspace in order to generate
   the graphics.

4. The webserver must be allowed to execute the scripts in the
   included bin/ dir.

5. If you think you are ready, copy the content of the www/ folder in your
   webspace.

6. Adjust the $graphpath variable in emsqry.inc to fit your needs.

7. Look through the scripts in bin/ and adjust all paths to fit your needs.

8. Ensure again the ems-collectord is configured as above and its logfiles
   are readable by the webserver.

9. Add a cronjob that periodically calls the bin/calcemsgraphs.sh script 
   in order to generate the statistic graphs.

10. If you want to get an e-mail in case of a problem, adjust the
    bin/emsperiodiccheck.php script and add a cronjob to call it 
    periodically.

11. Navigate with your webbrowser to the webspace and open the
    index.php file (if that does not happen automatically).

12. If something does not work, check the webserver log
    for details.
